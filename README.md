### PExambrok2

This is a modified version of the Exambrok2 exam app. The original app was designed 
to prevent cheating by using screen pinning and other restrictive features.
In this modified version, those features have been relaxed.  Changes include:

- Screen pinning disabled by default. 
- Bluetooth and earphone detection disabled. 
- Device volume set to 0 to prevent sounds when leaving the form. 
- Standard screen activity used instead of a floating activity.
- Allow Screen Capture, Copy/Paste

Exambrok2 simply embeds a Google Form and does not provide foolproof exam security.
Im really Sorry to the developer for doing this to your app, but thanks because now i understand dalvik from doing this project.
The app is available inside `dist`.
